== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How accurate is the reading time calculation? =

The reading time is calculated using industry-standard methods: word count divided by reading speed (default 180 WPM). The algorithm:
* Strips HTML tags and shortcodes for accurate word counting
* Rounds to the nearest half-minute for user-friendly display
* Can be customized per post type or content category using filters

= Does the text-to-speech feature require internet connection? =

No internet connection is required for the text-to-speech feature. It uses your browser's built-in Web Speech API, which works completely offline once the page is loaded.

= Which browsers and devices support text-to-speech? =

**Desktop Browsers:**
* Chrome 33+ (excellent support)
* Firefox 49+ (good support)
* Safari 7+ (good support)
* Edge 14+ (good support)

**Mobile Devices:**
* iOS Safari 7+ (full support)
* Chrome Mobile 33+ (full support)
* Android Browser (varies by version)

= Can I customize the reading speed? =

Yes! You can customize reading speed in several ways:
1. Use the `wpm` parameter: `[readtime wpm="200"]`
2. Use filters to set different speeds for different content types
3. Default is 180 WPM, but you can set anywhere from 100-400 WPM

= How do I style the reading time display? =

You can customize the appearance using:
1. **Custom CSS classes**: `[readtime class="my-custom-class"]`
2. **Theme stylesheet**: Target `.readtime`, `.read-time-line`, `.read-aloud-line` classes
3. **Custom CSS**: Add styles to your theme's Additional CSS section

Example:
```css
.readtime {
    background: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```

= Does it work with custom post types? =

Yes! WP Read Tools works with any post type including:
* Posts and pages
* Custom post types (products, events, etc.)
* Any content type that supports `the_content()` filter

= Can I add reading time automatically to all posts? =

Yes, you can automatically add reading time to posts using theme integration:

```php
// Add to functions.php
function auto_add_reading_time($content) {
    if (is_single() && !is_admin()) {
        $reading_time = do_shortcode('[readtime read-aloud="yes"]');
        return $reading_time . $content;
    }
    return $content;
}
add_filter('the_content', 'auto_add_reading_time');
```

= Is the plugin translation ready? =

Yes! The plugin is fully translation-ready with:
* Complete English text domain
* Spanish (es_ES) translation included
* POT template file for easy translation
* Support for RTL (right-to-left) languages

* < 100ms additional page load time
* < 1MB additional memory usage
* Only 2 additional HTTP requests (CSS + JS)
* Compatible with all major caching plugins

= How secure is the plugin? =
